- An extractor is a function that runs before prompts are sent to an LLM.  It can _extract_ some data from a project directory in order inject context into a set of prompts.

- Create a docker container that expects a project bind mounted at `/project` and that writes `application/json` encoded data to `stdout`.  The data written to `stdout` is what will be made available to any subsequent prompt templates.  
  id:: 66d8a36a-432f-4d1a-a48c-edbe0224b182
  To test your extractor function, run
  ```sh
  docker run \ 
    --rm -it \
    --mount type=bind,source=$PWD,target=/project \
    --workdir /project \
    image-name:latest arg1 arg2 ....
  ```
	- this would make your current working directory available to the extractor at `/project`
	- you can also arrange to pass arguments to the extractor function when you define the extractor metadata
- Once you have defined an extractor image (eg `image-name:latest`), create an entry in the prompt file to reference it.

  I can now inject context into the prompt using moustache template syntax.
  {{#my-extractor}}
  {{.}}
  {{/my-extractor}}
  ```
