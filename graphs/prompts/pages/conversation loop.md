alias:: conversation-loop

- A conversation loop is the exchange of messages between agents.  In an agentic workflow, agents with different roles exchange messages in order to complete a task.  Beyond roles like `system`, and `user`, we also have roles like `assistant` and `tool`.  An `assistant` might request that a particular `tool` do something on it's behalf.  A `tool` agent might represent certain capabilities that we add to an `assistant` that improve it's autonomy to carry out tasks on the user's behalf.  Here's an example conversation from our [[linkedin series]] of posts on [Dockerfile generation](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/docker-labs-genai-3-docker-xkjre/?trackingId=THZlzp%2FJQBKzpF0cbWghkQ%3D%3D).

	  First, analyze the project to determine how it should be built.  Once the analysis is complete, create a Dockerfile to build that project.

	  ```
	  [{:function {:arguments "{}" :name "analyze_project"}}]
	  ```
	- **Tool**
	  This is an NPM project

	  I have written the Dockerfile for your NPM project. You can find it in your project folder. This Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build process to efficiently build and run your application within a Docker container. The first stage fetches the runtime dependencies, the second stage builds the application, and the final stage runs the application. Please let me know if you need further assistance.
